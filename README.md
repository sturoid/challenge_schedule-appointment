## Your mission...if you choose to accept it...

Prototype a web application for scheduling an appointment

## Requirements

### User Stories

- As a User, I want to see which coaches I can schedule with.
- As a User, I want to see what 30 minute timeslots are available to schedule with a particular
  coach.
- As a User, I want to book an appointment with a coach at one of their available times

## Anti-Requirements

Common questions or things that may get in the way

- **You can't do it all**. We respect your time, and expect that you will have to make choices and tradeoffs for what is in scope for your deliverable.
- **Donâ€™t worry about authentication**. Assume a non-authenticated experience to keep things simple
- **Pick your stack**. Choose any libraries that help you produce the highest quality work in the time available.
